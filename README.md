# sokoban
Terminal based game of sokoban.

Controls: arrow keys and "q".
Goal:     all boxes should be put in "places"

Main principles (goals i was pursuing):
 - game contains multiple colors (to be pretty)
 - maps are external (".txt" files). They are easy to create/change without going into ".py" files
 - it is easy to customize parameters: color of object and it's background; symbol for object
