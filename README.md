# sokoban
Terminal based game of sokoban.

Controls: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Arrow keys and "q".

Goal:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* All boxes should be put in "places"

Main principles (goals I was pursuing):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - game contains multiple colors (to be pretty)
 - maps are external (".txt" files). They are easy to create/change without going into ".py" files
 - it is easy to customize parameters: color of object and it's background; symbol for object
